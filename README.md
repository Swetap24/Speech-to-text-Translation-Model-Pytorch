Machine translation Model with attention model and Pyramidal BiLSTM to reduce computational complexity


Neural machine translation (NMT) is an approach to machine translation that uses an artificial neural network to predict the likelihood of a sequence of words, typically modeling entire sentences in a single integrated model.
